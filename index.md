# About Me  

## A quick insight  
Hey there!   
I'm Ashutosh Purohit,currently a junior at <b>Birla Institute of Technology and Science Pilani,Pilani campus, India</b>, pursuing my B.E(Hons) in Manufacturing Engineering.  
Though I've barely started on my own journey into the world , its quite obvious to notice that the advent of <b>technolgy, engineering and research has revolutionized our era</b>. I strongly believe that there is no problem that cannot be handled by these three pillars. Infact every course I've studied in college has helped me <b>gain different perspectives into everyday objects and matters</b>, be it the design of a simple tool or the working of a complex drive mechanism , everything ends up yielding an array of possiblities that could've been used to achieve the same desired output.   

## Interests  
I have a <b>deep passion in designing mechanisms ,optimizing process flows and using Artificial Inteligence </b>to aid me in my tasks. <b>Designing Neural Networks that can not only give the best parameters to optimize a process</b> but can also create completely new designs to perform a desired task, is what intrigues me the most.


## The Rest of Me \o/
While not engaged in some nerdy activity I spend quite an<b> ampful of time hitting the gym , sprinting around the squash or volleyball court and trying my hand on any other sport</b> that excites me. To rejuvinate and relax myself from the entire days work I confide in my<b> flute and piano</b>. Playing music has been my best tool to cope with stress. That being said I also am an <b>avid reader</b> and love to get lost in the realm of mystery and sci-fi.
