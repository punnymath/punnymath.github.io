# About Me  

## A quick insight :eyeglasses:
Hey there!   
I'm Ashutosh Purohit,currently a junior at <b>Birla Institute of Technology and Science Pilani,Pilani campus, India</b>, pursuing my B.E(Hons) in Manufacturing Engineering.  
Though I've barely started on my own journey into the world , its quite obvious to notice that the advent of <b>technolgy, engineering and research has revolutionized our era</b>. I strongly believe that there is no problem that cannot be handled by these three pillars.These three pillars have offered strong foundation to solve global challenges.Fortunately my academic exposure has helped gain deeper insights. As a result I have gained amazing perspective to observe everyday objects, matters and situations around me, be it the design of a simple tool or the working of a complex drive mechanism.   

## Interests :eyes:
I have a <b>deep passion in designing mechanisms ,optimizing process flows and using Artificial Inteligence </b>to aid me in my tasks. <b>Designing Neural Networks that can not only give the best parameters to optimize a process</b> but can also create completely new designs to perform a desired task, is what intrigues me the most.


## The Rest of Me :v:
While not engaged in some nerdy activity I spend quite an<b> ample amount of time hitting the gym , sprinting around the squash or volleyball court and trying my hand on any other sport</b> that excites me. To rejuvinate and relax myself from the entire days work I confide in my<b> flute and piano</b>. Playing music has been my best tool to cope with stress. That being said I also am an <b>avid reader</b> and love to get lost in the realm of mystery and sci-fi.
