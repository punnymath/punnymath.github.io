# ROBOCON 2017

## About the Competition
The Asia-Pacific Robot Contest,<a href="http://aburobocon.net/"><b> ABU_Robocon</b></a>, is an Asian Oceanian College robot competition wherin robots compete to complete a task within a set period of time. The theme of the competition is different every year. For the year 2017 the <b> theme was"Asobi: The landing disc"</b>. The theme revolves around the word “asobi” (play), which is also a fundamental philosophy behind Robocon. A video explaining the theme more elaborately is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boUMyBLQ_O0"><b>here</b>.</a>  
The theme of the competition is made available to the contestant teams at the <b> start of September and the competition is held within the first week of March </b>.

## Task
The task at hand was to  <b>build a bot that could move along a straight line and also shoot disks at balls placed on seven poles </b> spaced out in different locations in the arena. However after displacing the ball, the disk was supposed to  <b>land on the pole  </b>in order to earn a point in the game.

## My Design
The bot was driven by a  <b>holonomic omni drive </b>, with a  <b>hexagonal base consisting of 6 hollow aluminium pipes </b>. <b>The shooter consisted of a sector of circle through which the disk would be thrown out</b>. The loading mechanism consisted of stepper motor attached with a pulley mechanism to propell the loaded disks into the shooter.
