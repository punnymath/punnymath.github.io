## Detection of Windmills from Satellite Images using Deep Neural Networks 
<medium>May 2017-July 2017</medium>

<p><b>Developed a neural network implementing the googLENET algorithm</b> to detect windmills in a satellite image at <b>ISRO, Jodhpur</b>.The network was concieved from a tensorflow API - TensorBox. In a three membered team I was assigned the role of extracting around 2000 satellite images and also pipelining the neural network. To get satellite images I <b>wrote scripts in Python that took in coordinates and downloaded the images from GoogleMaps</b>.The network will be<b> used by ISRO for the purpose of analysis and documentation</b>. </p>

## Effect of cutting tool parameters on surface roughness using Neural Networks
<medium>Feb 2017</medium>

<p>The drive behind the project was to <b>understand the cutting tool parameters that would result in the least surface roughness</b>. We, a two membered team, chose <b>64 combinations of feed, cutting speed and depth of cut </b>and worked on a rod of mild steel. At each trial we evaluated the surface roughness using a roughness tester. After completing this task we then used the <b>nntoolbox inbuilt within MATLAB</b> to process our data and also compute the optimal values of the cutting tool parameters</p>

## Designing and manufacturing an autonomous robot and a semi-autonomous robot
<medium>Mar 2016</medium>

<p> As part of <b>Team Robocon</b>,Bits Pilani, we built two robots to compete in a pan-Asia competition <a href="http://aburobocon.net/"><b>ABU-Robocon</b></a> 2016. Find out more about the project <a href="/Robocon2016/"><b>here</b></a>.</p>

## Self-Regulating Eye Distance Maintainer
<medium>Dec 2016 - Jan 2017 </medium>

<p>Worked on building a working model of a <b>device that could carry a smart phone while constantly monitoring and adjusting the distance of the eye from the phone screen to reduce any strain to the eye</b>. The model consisted of two arms being operated by a <b>pair of servo motors connected to an arduino</b>. The design was seleceted for the <b>second round of APOGEE, Bits Pilani</b>(The University Technical Fest) </p>
