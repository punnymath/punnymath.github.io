## Placement Commitee
<medium>March 2016 - Present</medium>    
<p><medium>Position held: <b>Junior Core Member</b> (March 2017 - Present)</medium></p>
<p>Being one of the <b>6 junior core team members</b> of the placement commitee requires me to <b>interact with Human Resource Managers</b> of various companies as well as ensure that the placement process runs smoothly throughout the year.</p>

<p>My journey with the placement unit has been enthralling. Though I've been with the team only a few months now, I can still observe the vast skill-set that the commitee is helping me polish. Be it improving <b>communication and convincing</b> or <b>managing huge workflow</b>, the commitee leaves no stone left unturned to keep me raising my bar higher and higher.  </p>

## Team Robocon
<medium>September 2015 - August 2017</medium>  
<p><medium>Position held:<b> Mechanical Sub-system Head </b>(Aug 2016 - Aug 2017)</medium></p>
<p><b>Team Robocon</b> is a technical team within the campus, that participates in a pan-asia competition <a href="http://aburobocon.net/"><b>ABU-Robocon</b></a>. Every year the team <b>designs and manufactures robot(s) </b>as per the theme of the competition.</p>

<p>Find my <b>projects and contributions</b> towards the team <a href="/Projects/#robocon"><b>here</b></a>.</p>

<p>During the second year with the team, I along with six other members were the <b>only seniors within the team</b>, bringing down huge resposibilities on us to keep the team efficient enough to participate in the competition. Also being the only senior member with <b>skills in Design and Mechanics</b>,I had to not only design the robot but also train newly recruited members for the same. This helped me<b> strengthen my knowledge in design and production</b> while also improving my ability to <b>clearly communicate ideas</b>.  </p>
