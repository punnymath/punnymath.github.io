# Organisations

## BITSACM
<small>Jan 2016 - Present</small><br>
<small>Position held: Treasurer, Web Master (June 2017 - Present)</small>
<p><a href="http://bitsacm.acm.org/">BITSACM</a> has been awarded as the best student chapter in India for the past 4 consecutive years. Find my contributions to <a href="http://bitsacm.acm.org/">BITSACM</a> <a href="/organisations/BITSACM/">here</a>.</p>

<p>My journey with BITSACM has been a remarkable one. It has played an impeccable role in shaping me as a team player and an innovator. Most of my technical work for BITSACM has been regarding Web Development and Machine Learning, but apart from that the major work went into organising, managing and communicating with team-mates. The values of discipline, leadership and responsibility were nurtured in me through BITSACM.</p>

<p>I have been actively participating in all the event management and development of the chapter since I joined it. I have been active in recruitments, fests and all the meets conducted by and for the chapter.</p>

## CODING CLUB
<small>Jan 2016 - Present</small><br>
<small>Position held: APOGEE Co-ordinator (June 2017 - Present)</small>
<p>Coding Club is a relatively new organisation which consists of a group of coding enthusiasts, keen on promoting and encouraging programming culture in the campus of BITS Pilani, Rajasthan. Our skills are made eveident through the events that we conduct on campus throughout the academic year. It is the only technical club/association on campus currently that works with Game Engines for Game Development.</p>

<p>Find my projects and contributions towards Coding Club <a href="/organisations/CodingClub/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Since Coding Club is relatively new, I have faced a big challenge of uniting all the sub-teams to work as one unit in integrity. I have taken up initiatives of Technical Group Discussions and a Special Interest Group for competitive/sport coding to improve the communication and unity across the batches.</p>
