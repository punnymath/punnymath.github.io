# ROBOCON 2016

## About the Competition
The Asia-Pacific Robot Contest,<a href="http://aburobocon.net/"><b> ABU_Robocon</b></a>, is an Asian Oceanian College robot competition wherin robots compete to complete a task within a set period of time. The theme of the competition is different every year. For the year 2016<b> the theme was "Clean Energy Recharging the World"</b>. The concept behind the theme was the utilization of renewable energy sources.A video explaining the theme more elaborately is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXpAXE76P4c"><b>here</b>.</a>  
The theme of the competition is made available to the contestant teams at the <b>start of September and the competition is normally held in the first week of March</b>.

## Task
The task required was to <b>build two robots</b>, one named the <b>Hybrid bot</b> and the other the <b>Eco Bot</b>. The Hybrid bot was to be manufactured with <b>semi-autonomous properties</b> to be able to <b>line follow, climb poles and also propel the Eco Bot</b>. On the other hand the eco bot was to be an <b>autonomous bot</b> that was to be propellled by the hybrid bot. Any sort of <b>elctrical power within the eco bot could only be used to actuation purpose</b> to swivel/turn it.

## My Design
### The Hybrid Bot
The bot consisted of <b>two hexagonal frames</b> each manufactured from aluminium pipes with a <b>holonomic omni wheeled drive</b>. The hexagonal design helped <b>reduce metal consumption</b> as well as the <b>stress per pipe</b>. The frames were connected with <b>three pneumatics</b> to facilitate a <b>reciprocating motion</b>. Each frame further had <b>three smaller pneumatics</b> attached with grippers. These grippers along with the other pneumatics attaching the frames would <b>complete the task of climbing a pole</b>. The design <b>aimed at openeing one side of the hexagonal frame</b> and bringing the pole within the center of the bot and then <b>gripping the pole from the top and bottom</b>. The bot would then <b>alternately losen one grip, extend , tighten the other grip and then contract</b> until the top has been reached. The design to open one face of the bot to let the pole in, <b>constituted a 4 bar mechanism with a pneumatic</b>, whose design can be found <a href="#"><b>here</b>.</a> The reason to use a pneumatic in the 4 bar than a motor lies in the <b>high impulsive force required </b>to shut the face close. A motor giving out the same torque as the pneuamtic would have ended up being <b>much more costly</b>. A blower was attached to the top frame of the bot to propel the eco bot.

### The Eco Bot
The design of this bot was much simpler than the hybrid bot. It consisted of a <b>3 wheeled synchronous drive </b>along with a sail attached at its top to capture the wind blown by the hybrid bot's blower to propell itself. Also it had <b>IR sensor</b> attached at its front end to follow a line while being propelled.
