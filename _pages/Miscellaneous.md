## Assembly Language Scripts
<small>Jan 2017 - April 2017</small>

<p>The best way to understand the working of a computer's processor is by writting code at the assembly level. It wouldn't get better if it was in one of the courses of the college. Find some of the scripts that I wrote to do various things <a href="https://github.com/jbnerd/Micro-Proc_ASM_codes">here</a>.</p>
