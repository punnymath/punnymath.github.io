# Checkmate 2016 Pokemon-Go!
<small>Development Period: July 2016 - Aug 2016 </small>
<small>Event Hosted in the First week of September.</small>

<p>Checkmate is BITS Pilani's revolutionary quizzing event, where the participant's aptitude for analytical thinking and logic based problem solving is put to test. Hosted on a web based platform, it is conducted by the chapter in the fall semester of every academic year. The theme idea for September 2016 Checkmate was derived from the then popular game version japanese anime, POKEMON. The event saw a participation of more than 200 teams each of two students.</p>
