## Winter Study Program
<small>Dec 2016</small>

<p>Took upon the initiative to educate the freshers of the student chapter in version control using github. I along with another teammate forked some famous repos to see the working of their respective organisations, and some more to make contributions and hacks of their own.</p>

## SIG Introductory Lectures
<small>Sept 2016</small>

<p>Delivered Special Introductory level lectures to the freshers of BITSACM over topics from Back-end Web Development, Computer Networks and Linux OS.</p>

<p>It is one thing to understand a concept oneself, it is another and much more a difficult one to explain/convey them to others for their understanding. These were my first lectures in front of a big audience.</p>


## Checkmate 2016 Pokemon-Go!
<small>Development Period: July 2016 - Aug 2016 </small>
<small>Event Hosted in the First week of September.</small>

<p>Checkmate is BITS Pilani's revolutionary quizzing event, where the participant's aptitude for analytical thinking and logic based problem solving is put to test. Hosted on a web based platform, it is conducted by the chapter in the fall semester of every academic year. The theme idea for September 2016 Checkmate was derived from the then popular game version japanese anime, POKEMON.</p>
