# Project Myriad
<small>Sep 2015 - Jan 2016</small>

<p>From nothing but 20 kgs of aluminium to a beautiful car with a mileage of over 100 kilometres per litre, it had been a remarkable journey. A 6063-T6 tempered aluminium chassis, with a Bajaj 100cc engine, alloy disc brake wheels, and a fairing made of 200 GSM plain weave carbon fibre, Myriad packs the perfect punch. The whole car was manufactured in the Workshop of BITS Pilani.</p>
