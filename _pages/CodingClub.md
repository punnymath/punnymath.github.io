## ANC Portal
<small>Oct 2016 - Mar 2017</small>

<p>ANC stands for the famous All Night Canteen of BITS Pilani, which serves a variety of good quality food items with the uniqueness of operating till late nights. It often sees much crowd pouring in at night resulting in large queues near the billing counter. To reduce this queue, the then President of the Students' Union (2016-17) proposed the idea of ANC Portal.</p>

<p>This website would automate the billing process reducing the size of queues near the billing counter. This website was developed and hosted under coding club after getting the project of developing such a system. The backend for the website based system was writtend in Django 1.9.1 in python 3.5.2.</p>
